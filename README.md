### Download

`git clone https://github.com/dongyg/req92534.git`

### Run

Running this web application will create a virtual docker environment as a docker container on your host docker.

```sh
# Build
cd req92534 && ./1_build.sh

# Run
./2_run.sh
```

Use `1_build.bat` and `2_run.bat` instead if you are under Windows.

### Using

After the docker containers are up, please open a browser and access `http://localhost:8027`. The web page should be like this
